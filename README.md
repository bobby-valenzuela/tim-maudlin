## Project Description:

This website was built for Tim Maudlin, a Professor of Philosophy from NYU and it serves as a introduction to him and his work. I reached out to Tim because I'm an admirer of his work and offered a pro bono site for him. The site was completely designed and developed by me without the use of any templates or mockups.

## Technologies used:

### General_

-HTML5
-CSS3/SCSS
-Javascript (ES5/ES6)

### Specific_

- Vue JS 3.0 : The website itself was built on the Vue 3.0 JS framework using the Vue CLI and is fully mobile responsive. 
- Materialize CSS : I used materialize for the responsive grid system, and to handle small components (cards, tooltips, etc).
 - Google Material icons : Used icons throughout the site.
 - Flexbox : Used for each section to center elements and keep site mobile-responsive.
 - CSS Grid : Used on media section to layout videos.
 - SCSS : Styling written is SCSS.
 - Greensock Gsap : Used Gsap for animation using the ScrollTrigger plugin.
